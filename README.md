# Python_BMI_Calculator

I made this python application using PYQT5.

bmi.py file contains all codes of GUI design.

bmi_fucs.py file contains all functions and task of this application.

BMI Calculator.exe file is a working (executable) format file of the application for window.

You may need all the files and icons in the added hierarchy for the application in order to work properly.

Disclaimer: this is just a hobby project for non-commercial use only none of these icons belongs to me I just found them throw the internet.
